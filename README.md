# 42 Projects  

The 42 curriculum is divided into projects, each of which deals with a new concept that you have to learn.  
The projects are divided into ranks with increasing difficulty for each rank. Usually they also contain bonus objectives for an extra challenge.

## Rank 0

|Project|Description|Languages/technologies|
|-------|-----------|-------|
|[**libft**](https://github.com/jmolenaa/libft)|Create a library of funtioncs for later use in the curriculum. A lot fo these functions resemble standard C library functions.|C|

## Rank 1

|Project|Description|Languages/technologies|
|-------|-----------|-------|
|[**ft_printf**](https://github.com/jmolenaa/ft_printf)|Recreate the printf function with less features. Introduces you to variadic functions.|C|
|[**get_next_line**](https://github.com/jmolenaa/get_next_line)|Write a function that returns a line form the given file descriptor. Multiple calls allow for reading through the entire file.|C|

## Rank 2
